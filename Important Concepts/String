  The function returns the index of the first occurrence of sub-string, if the sub-string is not found it returns string::npos.
  
  string s;
  s.find(delimeter) -> returns the index of first occurence of substring present in "delimeter". If we don't pass anything in 2nd parameter, 
                       then it will start searching from index 0.
  s.find(delimeter, pos) -> this will start searching from index "pos" given in 2nd parameter.
